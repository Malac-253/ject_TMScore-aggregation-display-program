Do you like anyone and just don't try approaching them or you can't get interested in anyone in particular? , ,I do not approach women. Ever. Not a virgin though. , ,I pity you for all the thirsty anons (You)ing you thinking that they can get a gf on 4chan of all places , ,I'm sure they are underaged , ,Happened to me before. , ,Be a man with value and something to offer.  Right now you are as useful as an old dog that shifts himself., ,LOL , ,Build a life where you can successfully support a female in your life and her lifestyle with you. That means having: >your finances in order >a home for her to live in >a lifestyle for her to participate in >a future for both of you to work towards >an honest demeanor so she doesn't leave  The primary thing is honesty. Once a girl knows you'll lie and cheat, she won't stay. Remember this. Treat young women like your mother: respect them and treat them right- make them happy., ,
