working a job that pays 45k/yr. Going to take my last prerequisites for dental school. If I don't get into dental school then I guess I'll try and get a masters in an engineering discipline with financial assistance from my company. But i really hope i get in for my own sanity. I also feel like even if i become a dentist i won't be successful enough. I'm trying to learn programming in my free time, maybe I can develop something useful in the future and get some income from that. Idk, I'm at a weird point right now., ,
