, ,I draw hentai art and fetish comics. Yes its my dream job because i work from home and am my own boss. I work primarily from patreon, so the harder i work, the higher my pay. Not towards retirement; im working towards paying off my house so i can own it within the next 10 years. Then i wouldnt have to worry about the rent. Only the $150 for utilities. Its my dream job but i also dont love it. I love the pay and freedom, but i hate basically drawing the same shift over and over again. Its always the same just slightly different angle or story., ,How reasonable is it for someone to get into Patreon commission work if they draw as a hobby? , ,It depends on your skill level. I have seen people who draw as a hobby but draw like a GOD. I have seen professionals draw like shift. Its also important to note that STYLE means everything. Patrons dont care if you can draw realistically or even decent anatomy. They care about your style. Niche fetish is also important. If you pick something too broad and general, then you wont get subs. You need to pick a fetish that is very obscure and lacking in art. Youll become that fetish community's God. Theyll trample over each other to commission you.  But it all depends on skill, style, and how much work youre willing to put in. If its just a hobby and youre not passionate, it will show in your work. Fans can tell immediately.  I didnt get to $4000 a month worth of patrons for hobby art. I draw daily and post daily. I pump out a comic every 2 weeks. It comes easily to me since its my passion. But it will become your burden if you arent passionate about it and only proclaim it to be a hobby., ,
