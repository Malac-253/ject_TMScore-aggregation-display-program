bump, ,Massage therapy, pays decent and is pretty chiil once you get the hang of it. , ,is it worth becoming a massage therapist as a male, or is there no chance? , ,I'm male. It definitely is. Male therapists mainly get avoided by other men, and super conservative women. You just have to be very careful with draping and secondary contact, but there’s plenty of people that like the way a mans hands feel, even if it is just in their heads that men give stronger massages. The deepest pressure therapists I've known are women and they are brutal. , ,I went to get worked on by a message therpist after getting my back ducked up in a crash, and she poked her fingers in my back so hard it literally felt like I was going to pass out from the pain. I stopped visiting, but does it get any better than that? Shift was terrible. , ,It does. Stick to light pressure massages. I see a lot of people with acute recent problems and the trick is to be gentle and patient, and eventually the muscles will feel safe enough to let go and relax.  In the mean time hot baths with loads of epsom salt would probably provide some relief for you., ,
